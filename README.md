# diffChinese

### Introduction
This module can be used to compare two Strings and output the differences similar to John Resig's Javascript Diff Algorithm (http://ejohn.org/projects/javascript-diff-algorithm/). It is also based on his script. Thanks, John!

The main difference is that this module supports finding differences in strings containing Chinese or other languages that use multi byte characters and/or don't separate words by spaces.
